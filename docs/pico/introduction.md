# Raspberry Pi Pico Introduction

Introduction to programming the Raspberry Pi Pico W with MicroPython.

## What is Raspberry Pi Pico W?

The Raspberry Pi Pico W is a low-cost microcontroller board with WiFi capabilities, perfect for IoT projects.

## Example Scripts

This project includes six complete examples:

1. [LED Blink](examples/blink.md) - Basic GPIO control
2. [WiFi Connection](examples/wifi-connect.md) - Network connectivity
3. [Signal Monitor](examples/signal-monitor.md) - WiFi strength monitoring
4. [Signal to Blink](examples/signal-to-blink.md) - Data visualization
5. [API Consumer](examples/api-consumer.md) - Consuming REST APIs
6. [Access Point](examples/access-point.md) - Creating WiFi AP with web interface

## Getting Started

1. [Install Thonny](../guides/thonny_installation.md)
2. [Flash your Pico](../guides/pico_flashing.md)
3. Try the examples above

## Source Code

All scripts are in `src/pico_scripts/` directory.
